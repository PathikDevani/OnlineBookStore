-> In this project server side and client both are in android app. but little difference in server & client. Server side in written in android dream work means "core JAVA" and client side written in "JavaScript".
-> Here we user two type of protocol for connection between Server & Client
    1) Http protocol : for load site from server
    2) Websocket : for live connection between server and client 
    
    Websocket is one type of socket . This is live connection so not load to page or not check every time to update. in this connection both client and server send MESSAGE to each other so not required to check update .
